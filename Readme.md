# The Witcher 3 Mod Manager

An application to simplify installing and managing mods for the game The Witcher 3.

## Description

The Witcher 3 Mod Manager is an application that simplifies installing and managing The Witcher 3 mods, originally developed by stefan3372 and now being continued here.

Now also found on the original [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2678)!
See there for screenshots and more information.

## Usage

Download and unpack the latest release from Nexus Mods or from the GitHub releases. If you are upgrading from version 0.6 or later, directly overwrite the previous installation.

A configuration file `config.ini` will be created under `Documents\The Witcher 3 Mod Manager`.
To run in portable mode, create a new `config.ini` in the same directory as the executable, or move the existing `config.ini` (along with the other config files) there.

Note: If you encounter issues with Script Merger, update to the recent release of [Script Merger Unofficial Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3395).

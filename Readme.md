# The Witcher 3 Mod Manager

The Witcher 3 Mod Manager is a tool that simplifies mod managing for the game The Witcher 3.

## Description

This is a fork of the original program by @stefan3372 that includes some additions and usability improvements.

Please check out his [original branch](https://github.com/stefan3372/The-WItcher-3-Mod-manager)
and his [release on Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2678).

For a list of changes, see [this pull request](https://github.com/stefan3372/The-WItcher-3-Mod-manager/pull/7).

## Usage

Download and unpack the [latest release](https://github.com/Systemcluster/The-Witcher-3-Mod-manager/releases/latest). It should be 100% backwards-compatible to the original version and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

A configuration file `config.ini` will be created under `Documents\The Witcher 3 Mod Manager`. To run in portable mode, simply create a new `config.ini` in the same directory as the executable or move the existing `config.ini` there.

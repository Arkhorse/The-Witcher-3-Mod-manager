## Usage

Download and unpack the [latest release](https://github.com/Systemcluster/The-Witcher-3-Mod-manager/releases/latest). It should be 100% backwards-compatible to the original version and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

A configuration file `config.ini` will be created under `Documents\The Witcher 3 Mod Manager`.  
To run in portable mode, create a new `config.ini` in the same directory as the executable, or move the existing `config.ini` (along with the other config files) there.
